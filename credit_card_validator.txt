Credit Card.

Using the Luhn Algorithm , we will be determining the validity of a given credit card number.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm
We want to create three main functions - card_number, card_type, and valid.

There are three functions:

determine_card_type should check whether or not the credit card has valid starting numbers and return the card type.

Visa must start with 4
Mastercard must start with 51, 52, 53, 54 or 55
AMEX must start with 34 or 37
Discover must start with 6011

check_length should check whether or not a credit card number is a valid length.

Visa, MC and Discover have 16 digits
AMEX has 15

validate should run the Luhn Algorithm and return true or false.

The Algorithm

From the right most digit, double the value of every second digit. For example:

4 4 8 5 0 4 0 9 9 3 2 8 7 6 1 6

becomes

8 4 16 5 0 4 0 9 18 3 4 8 14 6 2 6

Now, sum all the individual digits together. That is to say, split any numbers with two digits into their individual digits and add them. Like so:

8 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 5 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 3 + 4 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 6

Now take the sum of those numbers and divide by 10.

If the result is 0, the credit card number is valid.
